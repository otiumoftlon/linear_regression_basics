# Linear regression by gradient descent and its comparision with Sklearn methods
This python code generate a function that applies linear regression by gradient descent based in absolute error. Also this methods is used for modeling the ecommerce dataset in order to predict the yearly amount spent by users. Also it has a principal component analysis and correlation analysis in order to find the best features and gain insights on the data.
